### HOW TO CREATE REVIEWS
## Via pull requests
Create pull request between dev and master branches
> *master* = target branch
> *dev* = source branch
Collaborator creates a review skeleton, and link to it in the pull request. This review is NOT active at this point, 
#         and reviewers will not be notified of its existence until they are added in Collaborator, and the review is started. 
#      -> As developers work on the PR, the skeleton review will update in preparation for the review process.
